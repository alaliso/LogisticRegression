# LogisticRegression
## Logistic Regression ##
   * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
   * Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.
   * Implement the link function for logistic regression.
   * Function to compute the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to a single coefficient.
   * Implement gradient ascent.
   * Predict sentiments.
   * Compute classification accuracy for the logistic regression model.

## Logistic Regression with L2 regularization ##

  * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
  * Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.
  * Function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with an L2 penalty with respect to a single coefficient.
  * Implement gradient ascent with an L2 penalty.
  * Empirically explore how the L2 penalty can ameliorate overfitting.
